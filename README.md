```bash
npm install
```

Make sure your system has Node.js and Git installed.

## ‚ö† Windows SmartScreen Notice

> ‚ö† **If you're using a release version from GitHub or any distribution:**

Because OpenFrontApp is a new and unsigned application, **Windows may display a security warning** when launching the `.exe` for the first time.

This is normal and expected.

To proceed:

1. Click **"More info"**
2. Then click **"Run anyway"**

Once the app gains reputation or is digitally signed, this warning will no longer appear.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Mode

To run the app in development mode with live reload:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will open the app using Electron and load local resources. The console will print debug logs and load mods from your project directory.

## üì¶ Build for Production

To build the application for Windows:

```bash
npm run build:win
```

Other available targets:

- `npm run build:mac` ‚Äì macOS `.dmg`
- `npm run build:linux` ‚Äì Linux `.AppImage`

> Make sure your `assets/icon.ico` (Windows) or `icon.icns` (macOS) are valid and exist before building.

---

## üìÅ Mod Loading System

Mods are JavaScript files placed in the `mods/` folder. During the first launch, the app copies the default mods to:

```
%appdata%/openfrontapp/OpenFrontApp/mods
```

Only mods listed in `active-mods.json` will be activated on launch.
